Directions for use:

1. Make sure to have Astral/Fire Runes, Buckets of sand, and Seaweed in bank (preferrably next to each other).
2. Be standing next to bank.


NOTE:
1. A LOT of checks still have to be implemented. 
2. I've had succesful runs over an hour, but i'd still keep an eye on it.

TODO:
1. Script continue checks (means it will keep going even after you run out of materials)
2. Paint
3. Inv Checks
4. Calculations
